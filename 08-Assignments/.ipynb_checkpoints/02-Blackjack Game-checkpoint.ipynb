    "**Step 1:** Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to return a random card. \n",

    "*user_cards = []*\n",
    "*computer_cards = []*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Create a function called *calculate_score()* that takes a List of cards as input and returns the score. \n",
    "Look up the sum() function to help you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Inside *calculate_score()* check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** Inside *calculate_score()* check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up *append()* and *remove()*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** Call *calculate_score()*. If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7:** If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the *deal_card()* function to add another card to the *user_cards* List. If no, then the game has ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8:** The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Step 6 need to be repeated until the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9:** Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 10:** Create a function called *compare()* and pass in the *user_score* and *computer_score*. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 11:** Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack"
